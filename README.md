# Maths-For-Data-Science
Machine learning is all about maths, which in turn helps in creating an algorithm that can learn from data to make an accurate prediction. The prediction could be as simple as classifying dogs or cats from a given set of pictures or what kind of products to recommend to a customer based on past purchases. Hence, it is very important to properly understand the maths concepts behind any central machine learning algorithm. This way, it helps you pick all the right algorithms for your project in data science and machine learning.  Machine learning is primarily built on mathematical prerequisites so as long as you can understand why the maths is used, you will find it more interesting. With this, you will understand why we pick one machine learning algorithm over the other and how it affects the performance of the machine learning model.
